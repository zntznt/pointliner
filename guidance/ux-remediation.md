# Pointliner — UX Remediation Register

This is the **active fix list** that pairs with `ux-discipline.md`: the places the app does not yet
conform to the single interaction language, each a numbered defect to close. Under `ux-discipline.md`
§0 **any non-conformance is a defect, not a preference** — every bespoke syntax or one-off interaction
that didn't come from the standard is on this list (see the standing syntax-sprawl guard, UXP-20).

This is an **append-only register**: file a new non-conformance here as the next `UXP-NN`, with the
**problem**, the **rule** it violates, and the **target** end-state. When an entry ships conformant,
mark it resolved in place and move it to `ux-remediation-archive.md` (the closed-entries record), so
this file stays a short view of what is actually open. Verify any named symbol with grep before
acting (controls drift).

**Status:** ☐ open · ◐ in progress · ✓ closed (move to the archive on close)
**Severity:** 🔴 breaks the unified language · 🟡 partial / inconsistent · 🟢 cosmetic-but-tracked

> **Current state (2026-07-18):** the remediation program is essentially complete — every UXP/LF/QP/QX
> defect from Tiers 1–3, the correctness batch, and the many audit waves (UXP-3…199, the Lean-floor
> LF-* set, and the adversarial-robustness waves) is closed and archived in
> `ux-remediation-archive.md`. **Two items remain open below:** UXP-20 (standing guard, never closes)
> and UXP-170 (deferred — an egress-blocked FA-subset glyph rebuild; the fallbacks keep it legible).

## Open items

### UXP-20 ☐ Syntax sprawl — standing guard (P5)
- **Problem:** the loudest symptom of the scattered direction is the steady flood of new authoring syntaxes and grammars, each invented per-feature. The architecture *encourages* it (`CLAUDE.md`: "a new token type / expression primitive fits very well"), so the pressure is structural and continuous — this guard never fully closes.
- **Violates:** P5 (one authoring language).
- **Decisions recorded (owner, 2026-06-12):**
  - **Roll tables collapsed into grammar — the first executed P5-5 subsumption.** A named
    roll table IS a one-rule grammar; the separate artifact, sidecar, dialog, and
    `entry weight`-per-line syntax are retired (legacy records migrate on load, frozen
    results preserved). The `@` menu keeps the "Roll table" door — it opens the
    table-flavored grammar dialog. The §2 inventory **shrank** by one row.
  - **`#+TBLFM:` `@row$col` stays the one formula form for BOTH static tables and bases.**
    The named-column `{= expr}` migration idea was rejected: it would split the formula
    language across the two table forms (bases named, static tables positional). Echoes
    the standing `B3` rejection below.
  - **Markov does NOT collapse.** Directed-walk semantics (`A -> B 2` = transition from a
    current state) are genuinely different from weighted alternation; the calling side is
    already unified (`{chainName}` via the typed-descriptor rule). The definition syntax
    stays.
- **Decision recorded (owner, 2026-06-13) — search queries ship as search-box operators.**
  The "Boolean tag queries" watch item below is resolved: the query language is operators
  over the **existing** vocabulary — implicit AND, `-` negation, `"a b"` phrases, `#tag`
  (the hashtag row reused, word-anchored and hierarchical, so `#thread` matches
  `#thread/torn-letter`), and `is:done`/`is:todo`/`is:note` (the one new
  field-prefix pattern, a closed set). **OR is deferred** (precedence isn't worth deciding
  until real queries demand it). **No `state:` operator** — `#KEYWORD` states are
  hashtag-shaped, so `#waiting` already filters by state. The `evalMath` route
  (`tag("x") and not done()`) was **rejected** for v1 — predicates over nodes are not math
  on numbers, and function-call syntax lives nowhere else in the app; a future `={expr}`
  per-point predicate stays reserved as the power-user escape hatch (e.g. date queries)
  and must not be foreclosed by the parser. Malformed tokens (unknown `is:` value, lone
  `-`, `#non-word`) stay **literal text terms** — the `{…}` invalid-body escape-hatch rule,
  so a query never silently matches everything. §2 inventory row added in the same change.
- **Decision recorded (owner, 2026-06-13) — progress cookies ship as the Org `[/]`/`[%]` token.**
  The watch-list item below is resolved. The `{…}`-aggregation route was **weighed and not taken
  for v1**: a cookie is not inline-composed generative content the user nests — it is a fixed
  per-point *display* summary, conceptually the sibling of `#+TBLFM:` (edit shows the recipe,
  render shows the computed value). It reuses the **`[…]` bracket authoring family** already in
  the app (`[ ]`/`[x]`, `[#A]`, `[^key]`, `[[…]]`) rather than minting a sigil, and is the
  notation every outliner/Org user already knows (P1/P2). The token is **plain text** in
  `node.text` (no sidecar, OPML round-trips for free); the count is computed at render against the
  point's own checkboxes + direct children, each checkbox counted individually and each
  keyword/sequenced child once (done-ness via the sequence-aware `todoDoneFromText`). A literal
  `[/]`/`[%]` renders as a cookie **only when the point owns tasks**, else it stays text (the
  escape-hatch rule). Front door: `@progress`. §2 inventory row + `?`-panel/menu entry added in
  the same change. The general children-aggregation primitive (`sum`/`count`/`avg` via `evalMath`)
  remains the separate, still-`{…}`-routed feature — cookies did not foreclose it.
- **Two live examples to police now** (both in `roadmap.md`):
  - a proposed **render-only `{= expr}` / `{NdM}` second syntax** "alongside `[[type:key]]`" → **P5-3 violation** unless it *replaces* the existing path; route it through the `{…}` engine, don't add a parallel one.
  - possible **`B3`-style table references** beside `@row$col` → reject; `@row$col` is "the one true form."
- **Forward watch list (June 2026)** — the planned roadmap/backlog features that carry P5 risk, with the conformant route decided *before* build, not during:
  - **Cross-file links `[[docId#nodeId|label]]`** (Phase 2 step 5) — an *extension of an existing inventory row* (the node-link token grows a doc-id segment), not a new delimiter. Conformant via P5-5 (subsume, don't sibling) — but it is still an inventory-row **edit** and must be recorded in §2 + the `?` panel in the same PR (P5-4), not slipped in as a side effect.
  - ~~**Dates + agenda** (backlog Tier 1)~~ — **decided + shipped 2026-06-13**: the P5-gated decision is that dates live as a `due` **property** (`node.props`, value `YYYY-MM-DD` or relative `today+N`) — zero new authoring syntax, reuses the existing properties system. The `due:` search operator is a date-aware extension of the existing `key:value` operator family (not a new family). Inventory row added to `ux-discipline.md` §2. Front doors: `/due` slash verb, bullet menu, Agenda panel (toolbar). Org's `<2026-06-12 Wed>` / `SCHEDULED:` notation NOT imported.
  - **Aggregations over children** (roadmap generative ideas) — the roadmap sketch says "a new token type"; the UXP-20-preferred route is an `evalMath` primitive or `resolveBrace` branch (e.g. a children-scope function) so it rides `{…}`. A new token type needs the explicit-decision path.
  - ~~**Progress cookies `[2/5]` / `[40%]`** (backlog)~~ — **decided + shipped 2026-06-13** (see the decision record above): the recorded-decision path was taken — the Org `[/]`/`[%]` cookie, reusing the `[…]` bracket family as a computed display value (no sidecar), with `@progress` as the front door. The `{…}`-aggregation primitive stays a separate future feature.
  - ~~**Properties / per-node metadata** (backlog)~~ — **shipped**: `node.props = [{key, val}]` sidecar, dialog editor (bullet menu + chip click), `has:key`/`key:value` search operators, chips below the note row. No new authoring syntax — dialog-only editing, no typed sigil.
  - ~~**Boolean tag queries** (backlog "Tag power")~~ — **decided + shipped 2026-06-13** (see the decision record above): search-box operators over the existing vocabulary, with the focus-shown legend + `?` panel as front doors.
  - **Oracle / decks / bags** (roadmap generative ideas) — conformant by construction *if* they register as grammar-engine callables the way markov does (`{name}` resolution via a typed descriptor in `collectRules`); flag any version that wants its own inline notation.
- **Audit recorded (owner, 2026-06-16) — inventory↔parser reconciliation.** A full sweep of the authoring entry points (inline `mdInline`, block `mdToHtml`, the `/` + `@` menus, the `{…}` grammar forms) found the closed §2 inventory under-documented the **Markdown family**: inline links/images/autolinks, GFM pipe tables, and definition lists shipped but were absent from the inventory and (most) from the `?` panel; `[text](url)` was in the `?` panel but not the inventory, and `++` underline the reverse. **Resolved (documentation only):** the §2 Markdown row + the `?` panel **Format (markdown)** section now list the full CommonMark/GFM surface the renderer ships — standard markdown, no app-specific syntax, no sign-off needed. **No new sprawl and no subsumption to execute** were found elsewhere (every other typeable form maps to a row; the roll-tables→grammar collapse already did the one available subsumption). A P5-4 completeness fix, not a P5-1 growth — the guard holds.
- **Target / standing rule:** every new generative or computed feature plugs into the `{…}` grammar engine or extends `evalMath`; no new top-level delimiter ships without sign-off **and** the retirement of what it overlaps. The §2/P5 inventory is the closed set; growing it is an explicit, recorded decision, never a side effect of a feature. This row stays open permanently as the gate the AI checks against — it is the antidote to "new ways of doing syntax pulled out of thin air."


### UXP-170 ☐ The estimate pill shares the width-resize glyph fa-left-right (design-language §1) 🟢  [Batch 5] (DEFERRED — github-egress-blocked glyph rebuild)
- **Problem:** §1 records that `fa-left-right` was narrowed to "the horizontal-span concept only" when refile moved to `fa-arrow-right-arrow-left`, but estimate never got the same treatment — the width control and the uncertainty pill still share one glyph (5 est sites). A live contradiction of a locked Decision-corollary. Harm minimal (icon aria-hidden, labels correct), P5-drift.
- **Rule:** design-language §1 (one glyph per concept).
- **Target:** give estimate its own identity glyph (a wave/tilde/distribution mark matching the ∿/≈ fallbacks) and retire `fa-left-right` from all five est sites, the move refile got. Needs the FA subset rebuild (`tools/build-fa-subset.py`) — **github-egress-blocked in this sandbox**, so DEFER the glyph swap to a networked machine; the fallbacks keep it legible meanwhile.
